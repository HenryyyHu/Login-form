This is my Login project created by Henry Hu
I had to use a differenet file from the one provided because the one provided was not working correctly on my mac
I have 3 html templates in my machine, a home page, login page and a signup page
First, you get to the login page and try to log in, if you cant you can register an account and then log in fully. Then it will take you to the home page
Finally, I have an app.py file that runs the code in python. It takes the html files and runs them togeter to create an effective and working log in page
I also added some images, colors and other designs to make the page more interesting.
